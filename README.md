# Before After Comparison

This Python application allows for interactive comparison of before-and-after photos.  Users can easily switch between images and visually assess the differences.  This is particularly useful for applications such as construction progress tracking, real estate comparisons, or medical imaging analysis.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **Streamlit:**  Used for building the interactive web application.
* **Leafmap:**  Used for creating the interactive before-and-after photo display.  Leafmap's capabilities allow for seamless integration and intuitive comparison of the images.

## Installation

1. **Download:** Download the `app.py` file and the `requirements.txt` file from this repository.

2. **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the downloaded files, and run:

> pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the App: Once the dependencies are installed, run the application using the following command in your terminal:
> streamlit run app.py
This will launch the application in your web browser.
